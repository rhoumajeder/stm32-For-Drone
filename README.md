# stm32ForDrone

I share this code to show how you can build a drone from scratch based on stm32 microcontroller , 
the code give some details on   how you can calibrate the ESC , make PID for equilibre , get data from sensors like gyroscope 
and accelerometer ....
You can also use seperately different parts of this project , For example if you just looking for a code to calibrate 
you ESC  , you can just find it in main.c , same thing for sensors ..
